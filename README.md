# Freyr - The weather API, on the edge

> Freyr, in Norse mythology, the ruler of peace and fertility, rain, and sunshine and the son of the sea god NjÃ¶rd.
> Thor was taken

The idea of this API is to provide a nice and simple interface for the worlds weather offices. The API will never pull from already aggregated sources to allow developers to use the data. This does mean the API needs providers for every country / region it wants to support so if you wish to add your own countries weather office, feel free to make a pull request!

### Currently supported countries

- United States (National Weather Service)
